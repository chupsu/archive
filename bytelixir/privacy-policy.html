                  The processing of Personal Data is performed in accordance

                  regulations.
                  <br>
                  Where regulations of the country of Your locations provide for
                  stricter Personal Data standards, the processing of Your

                  Please be advised that the revocation shall only have effect
                  for the future. Any processing that was carried out prior to
                  the revocation shall not be affected thereby.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Agreement Performance.</b> It means processing Your data
                  where it is necessary for the performance of an agreement to
                  which You are a party or to take steps at Your request before

                <h2>How We Secure Your Personal Data?</h2>
                <p>
                  We have implemented several technical, organizational, and
                  administrative measures to ensure the confidentiality,
                  integrity, availability, and privacy of Your Personal Data and
                  to protect Your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized
                  access, misuse, alteration, or destruction which are generally
                  accepted by the industry to protect the Personal Data in its
                  possession.
                  <br>
                  These measures include but are not limited to the
                  implementation of current security technologies: Secure
                  Sockets Layered (SSL) technology to ensure that Your Personal
                  Data is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely,
                  secure coding principles, and regular penetration testing.
                  <br>
                  We also use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted
                  to and from the System. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a
                  protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two
                  communicating applications. It's the most widely deployed
                  security protocol used today and is used for Web browsers and
                  other applications that require data to be securely exchanged
                  over a network, such as file transfers, instant messaging, and
                  voice over IP.
                  <br>
                  Only authorized Company personnel have access to the Personal
                  Data, and these personnel are required to treat the Personal
                  Data as confidential. The security measures in place will,
                  from time to time, be reviewed in line with legal and
                  technical developments.
                  <br>
                  If You become aware of any potential data breach or security
                  vulnerability, You are requested to contact Us immediately. We
                  will use all measures to investigate the incident, including
                  preventive measures, as required.
