                    Users do not have access to the Recipient User’s
                    information, including their device and fact of connection,
                    while Recipient Users do not have access to the information

                  <li>
                    The Recipient User can request Internet bandwidth from a
                    particular country or region. The Company analyzes these
                    requests with the amount of shared bandwidth and the
                    available functions of the Platform and can at its
                    discretion accept or reject the request of the Recipient

                  <li>
                    There is different demand for Internet bandwidth, thus not
                    all Users will be able to share the same amount of it. If
                    there is excessive Internet bandwidth coming from a specific
                    __cpLocation, the Platform may limit the amount of shared
                    bandwidth to avoid data server overload. To ensure the high
                    speed and quality of the connection, the Platform limits the
                    number of connections to the same IP address. This allows
                    the Users to have a stable connection and increase their
                    remuneration. The number of connections may vary based on
                    network and market conditions. The information about the
                    limitations and their possible changes can be found on the

                    Accepting these Terms, the User agrees that Internet
