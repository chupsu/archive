                In order to facilitate Our global operations, Our Company may use the services of overseas data processing service providers, unless Your jurisdiction laws and regulations limit such data transfer.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hereby warrant You that We will only transfer Your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal data by the European Commission.

                How We Secure Your Personal Data?
              </h2>
              <p>
                We have implemented several technical, organizational, and administrative measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of Your Personal Data and to protect Your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized access, misuse, alteration, or destruction which are generally accepted by the industry to protect the Personal Data in its possession.
              </p>
              <p>
                These measures include but are not limited to the implementation of current security technologies: Secure Sockets Layered (SSL) technology to ensure that Your Personal Data is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely, secure coding principles, and regular penetration testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from the System. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It's the most widely deployed security protocol used today and is used for Web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network, such as file transfers, instant messaging, and voice over IP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only authorized Company personnel have access to the Personal Data, and these personnel are required to treat the Personal Data as confidential. The security measures in place will, from time to time, be reviewed in line with legal and technical developments.
              </p>
              <p>
                If You become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, You are requested to contact Us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.
