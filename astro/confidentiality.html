              <h2>What is the Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data?</h2>
              <p>
                The processing of Personal Data is performed in accordance with
                privacy rights and regulations following the EU General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Agreement and Our local
                regulations.
                <br>
                Where regulations of the country of Your locations provide for
                stricter Personal Data standards, the processing of Your
                Personal Data will be effectuated in accordance with these
                standards.
                <br><br>
                Generally, the legal grounds for the Personal Data Processing
                could be listed as follows:
                <br><br>
                <strong>Your Consent.</strong> Insofar as You have granted Us
                consent to the processing of Personal Data for specific
                purposes, the lawfulness of such processing is based on Your
                consent. Giving Us Your consent to the processing of Your
                Personal Data is voluntary. Any consent granted may be revoked
                at any time. Please be advised that the revocation shall only
                have effect for the future. Any processing that was carried out
                prior to the revocation shall not be affected thereby.
                <br>
                <strong>Agreement Performance.</strong> It means processing Your
                data where it is necessary for the performance of an agreement
                to which You are a party or to take steps at Your request before
                concluding an agreement. This includes the Agreement.
                <br>
                <strong>Our Legitimate Interest.</strong> It means Our interest
                to conduct and manage Our business affairs appropriately and
                responsibly, to protect the reputation of Our business, and to
                provide You with the best possible Services and secure
                experience.
                <br>
                <strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We process Your Personal Data
                where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory
                obligation.
              </p>
              <h2>Do We Transfer Your Personal Data Overseas?</h2>

                In order to facilitate Our global operations, Our Company may
                use the services of overseas data processing service providers,
                unless Your jurisdiction laws and regulations limit such data
                transfer.
                <br>
                We hereby warrant You that We will only transfer Your Personal
                Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate
                level of protection for Personal data by the European
                Commission. We will make all possible efforts to ensure
                protection of Your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy

                appropriate contractual or other steps to protect the relevant
                Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws.
                <br>
                Where such service providers are not established in a country
                ensuring an adequate level of protection within the meaning of
                Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the United States, the
                transfers will be covered by the standard data protection
                clauses adopted by the European Commission or by another
                appropriate safeguard mechanism such as the Privacy Shield
                Framework.
                <br>
                Where You access the System under the Providing Proxy mode, Your
                IP address may be transferred to other Users, including those
                who may be located abroad. Therefore, accessing the System under
                the Providing Proxy mode, You consent to such a transfer.

                integrity, availability, and privacy of Your Personal Data and
                to protect Your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized
                access, misuse, alteration, or destruction which are generally
                accepted by the industry to protect the Personal Data in its
                possession.
                <br>
                These measures include but are not limited to the implementation
                of current security technologies: Secure Sockets Layered (SSL)
                technology to ensure that Your Personal Data is fully encrypted
                and sent across the Internet securely, secure coding principles,
                and regular penetration testing.
                <br>
                We also use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted
                to and from the System. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a
                protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two
                communicating applications. It's the most widely deployed
                security protocol used today and is used for Web browsers and
                other applications that require data to be securely exchanged
                over a network, such as file transfers, instant messaging, and
                voice over IP.
                <br>
                Only authorized Company personnel have access to the Personal
                Data, and these personnel are required to treat the Personal
                Data as confidential. The security measures in place will, from
                time to time, be reviewed in line with legal and technical
                developments.
                <br>
                If You become aware of any potential data breach or security
                vulnerability, You are requested to contact Us immediately. We
                will use all measures to investigate the incident, including
                preventive measures, as required.

                  not affect the lawfulness of any processing which was carried

                Kindly note that none of the rights is absolute, meaning that
